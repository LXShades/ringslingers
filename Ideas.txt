 + Player input needs to be serialized
 + SyncedObject references are now serialized
 + Objects should be cleaned up when reverted to a state where they don't exist
 + FrameAwake needs to be called on objects that previously didn't exist (i.e. serialize startWasCalled) (should probably also serialize existence and erase objects as necessary)

+ Identify high packet rate cause
+ Fix ring blinking not working
+ Hit blink shouldn't start predictively when railing
======== PLAYTEST! ========
EFFORT:IMPACT

Fixes/Refinements
+ Fix mipmapping LOW:MID
+ Use Ignorance early update instead of late update LOW:MID
+ Fix flashing effect LOW:MID
+ Change buttons for FPS change LOW:MID
+ Kill Y needed in case player goes out of bounds MID:HIGH
- Fix rings dropping at 2FPS MID:MID
 -> probably an issue with disabling Mirror components during runtime? try clumsy.exe?
- Fullscreen support MID:HIGH
- Sound effects for other players (hit, ring throw at least) HIGH:MID
- Death state HIGH:LOW

Features:
* CTF mode + at least 1 map HIGH:HIGH
* Combinable rings HIGH:HIGH

Brand New Features:


Technical refinements in the future:
- Imrpove ring collisions by not using triggers
- Interpolate thrown rings
- Refine acceleration, this currently varies by frame rate
- Reuse BinaryWriters in SyncedObject.Serialize

Additional touches:
- Fireworks when hitting someone in the air

Gameplay ideas
- Bounce shield - has a cooldown, returns you to the height from whence you came
- Character ability: jump directly onto walls and/or ceilings
- Subterranean ring: When fired, travels underground. Firing again makes it spike out of the ground hitting anyone above it
- Chain ring: Ring bound by a chain. Fire and hold, and you can swing it as it goes out, whacking players from the side. Swing has a slight delay, as the movement ripples down the chain.

CTF:
+ Teamwork rewards
 + 'Low Rings'/'EMPTY' overhead alert for players with low ring count
 + Throwing weapon rings at players gives them the weapon (w/ autoaim to help them hit)
