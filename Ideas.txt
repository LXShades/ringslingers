=================== PLAYTEST! 7th FEB ===============
? Spawning as the wrong player glitch!?
? Multiple names glitch!? names getting swapped, IDs clearly wrong
+ Don't collide with other players anymore, it's awful LOW:MID
+ CTF team colors in chat LOW:MID
+ Lower the doppler effect LOW:MID
+ Players all seem to spawn in the same place LOW:HIGH
+ Names above players LOW:MID
+ Make a bot run around and stuff, so we can improve the hit detection for real HIGH:HIGH
+ REVERT the input buffer size being 1 whole second
+ Custom port for LJ sonic LOW:MID
+ Rebalance sound effects MID:MID
+ Player colours MID:MID
+ Fix ticker breaking on map change
+ Fix can't jump off walls and ceilings MID:MID

+ Add eyes to the monitors, sure MID:MID
+ Add bomb ring
+ Fix broken hits
+ Add bomb ring collision / damage effect
+ Do a first pass on ring-swapping or combining so maps can have multiple ring types
 + Multiple weapons should show in the HUD when you have multiple weapons picked up
 + Picking up auto increases other weapon speed
 + Picking up bomb causes explode on impact
+ Fix explosion not exploding when thrown by client to ground
+ Fix no message when hit with explosion
+ Play sound on Bomb-Rail contact
+ REMOVE PING SIMULATION
+ Remove planet map from rotation
+ Add combination rings to maps
+ Rail rings on clients end early
+ Add new Homing Ring (crosshair shape perhaps) MID:HIGH
- Maybe add more lenience for the net delay so that we don't put players behind too much

-- To watch for in future tests:
+ Predicted rings shouldn't spawn twice when you shoot them to a wall, should they? they should at least project beyond the wall
- Lag spikes should be better illustrated HIGH:LOW
- See what happens with low-FPS players and their extrapolation, letting them control how fast they go makes things look horrible
- Clients think they can dash when holding the flag

====== SMOKE TEST ! 7th FEB ===========

+ Auto Rings in nimbus LOW:HIGH
+ REMOVE M KEY LOW:HIGH
+ Flag needs to play return sound
+ Flag no longer drops in random directions
+ Serious freeze bug when level changes
 ---> try spamming map change
 ---> test in editor see how scenes are loading
 ---> HOPEFULLY fixed by only allowing scene change if not already on that scene
+ Fixing "flag always flashing" (hopefully)
+ Stairs suck
+ You can't get into the towers in Metal Star
- Clients cant handle the slopes in Desolate Twilight

======== PLAYTEST! LIKE JAN ISH ========
EFFORT:IMPACT

Fixes/Refinements
+ Fix mipmapping LOW:MID
+ Use Ignorance early update instead of late update LOW:MID
+ Fix flashing effect LOW:MID
+ Change buttons for FPS change LOW:MID
+ Kill Y needed in case player goes out of bounds MID:HIGH
+ Fullscreen support MID:HIGH (result: LOW:HIGH)
+ Fix dropped rings despawning on clients and causing errors LOW:LOW
+ Fix rings dropping at 2FPS MID:MID
 -> probably an issue with disabling Mirror components during runtime? try clumsy.exe?
 -> result: nope - it was Spawn being called with syncvars being assigned too late.
+ Fix physics HIGH:MIDHIGH
 + Needs to step up onto steps properly without affecting velocity
 + Needs to stop bouncing off of corners
 + Needs to still be able to run up walls
+ Level switch button MED:HIGH
- Simulate lag both ways

- Smoothen out packet flow HIGH:HIGH
 - An INetworkTick perhaps
 - A FlowSmoother component
 - Netplay or similar class should evaluate all INetworkTick components and handle flow control
 - Add local time to players, show in the scoreboard, with ping
 - Monitor packet size. Should ideally be <500 bytes minus header probably


- Find out why rings are hitting in different positions
 -> send collided point from server and tell the client where it was as a debug circle
 -> Client sets its own debug circle where its own ring hits
- Improve hit detection HIGH:MEDHIGH
 - Send current "gameTime" as received from server, and ping indicating how far we project players
 - Server has a tolerance for rewinding to client position and/or projecting rings. Maybe print out the time difference
 - Package player updates with "gameTime" and combine all into one
- Fix shaking on tight slopes HIGH:MED
- Sound effects for other players (hit, ring throw at least) HIGH:MID
- Death state HIGH:LOW
+ Getting hit into a corner freezes you

 + Player input needs to be serialized
 + SyncedObject references are now serialized
 + Objects should be cleaned up when reverted to a state where they don't exist
 + FrameAwake needs to be called on objects that previously didn't exist (i.e. serialize startWasCalled) (should probably also serialize existence and erase objects as necessary)

Brand New Features:

- Maybe a crosshair on the flag holder
- Bomb ring camera shake
- balloon sound / inflation animation when getting shield




Technical refinements in the future:
- Refine acceleration, this currently varies by frame rate

Additional touches:
- Fireworks when hitting someone in the air

Gameplay ideas
- Bounce shield - has a cooldown, returns you to the height from whence you came
- Character ability: jump directly onto walls and/or ceilings
- Subterranean ring: When fired, travels underground. Firing again makes it spike out of the ground hitting anyone above it
- Chain ring: Ring bound by a chain. Fire and hold, and you can swing it as it goes out, whacking players from the side. Swing has a slight delay, as the movement ripples down the chain.

CTF:
+ Teamwork rewards
 + 'Low Rings'/'EMPTY' overhead alert for players with low ring count
 + Throwing weapon rings at players gives them the weapon (w/ autoaim to help them hit)
