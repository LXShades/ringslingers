+ Add player spawn points
+ Make multiplayer testing work properly and EASILY
+ Spawn players on join
+ Sync player movement
+ Add client-side prediction
 + Revisit Rewinding ability in SyncedObjects
+ Add RespawnableItems
+ Add ring drop
 + Add ObjectMovement component
 + Rings should despawn after a while
 + Rings should have some friction when bouncing
 + Ring drop sound should play when hit
 + Players should be able to pick up rings
   Current options:
    - Use custom movement for players and detect, but selectively ignore rings
    + Set the dropped rings to use a trigger collider and let them be picked up that way
+ Add ring hits by other players
 + Red rings should collide with other players
+ Optimize physics step
+ Add knockback on hit
 + Normalize player speeds
 - Adjust speeds
+ Add score on hit
+ Add Tab to view scores
+ Add default player names
+ Flags should be serializable - they already seem to be
+ Added FPS counter
- Add client-side prediction and optimise
 + Implement tick history
 + Take snapshot on each tick
 + Every frame, rewind 0.2 seconds and execute 0.2 seconds
 + Player input needs to be serialized
 + SyncedObject references are now serialized
 + Objects should be cleaned up when reverted to a state where they don't exist
 + FrameAwake needs to be called on objects that previously didn't exist (i.e. serialize startWasCalled) (should probably also serialize existence and erase objects as necessary)
+ Things are breaking so make a Replay Mode to see frame-by-frame what's happening
+ Fix springs causing weird stuff
+ Make Rail model
+ Verify game works with multiple players without causing errors/breaks/etc
+ Add Rail powerup
+ Add icons to weapons/HUDs
+ Add monitor
+ Monitor should give reward
+ Monitor should make pop sound effect
+ Monitor should respawn
- Monitor should be synced properly

Post-playtest:
- Add rename ability
- Make Sonic model
- Add loop de loop
- Add spin

Technical refinements in the future:
- Imrpove ring collisions by not using triggers
- Interpolate thrown rings
- Refine acceleration, this currently varies by frame rate
- Reuse BinaryWriters in SyncedObject.Serialize

Additional touches:
- Fireworks when hitting someone in the air

Gameplay ideas
- Bounce shield - has a cooldown, returns you to the height from whence you came
- Character ability: jump directly onto walls and/or ceilings
- Subterranean ring: When fired, travels underground. Firing again makes it spike out of the ground hitting anyone above it
- Chain ring: Ring bound by a chain. Fire and hold, and you can swing it as it goes out, whacking players from the side. Swing has a slight delay, as the movement ripples down the chain.

CTF:
+ Teamwork rewards
 + 'Low Rings'/'EMPTY' overhead alert for players with low ring count
 + Throwing weapon rings at players gives them the weapon (w/ autoaim to help them hit)
